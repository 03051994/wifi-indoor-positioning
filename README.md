# wifi-indoor-positioning
## Summary
The aim is to locate a user thanks to WiFi packets sniffing from multiples Access Points on openWRT. The results are analyzed (according to the signal strength and MAC addresses) then sent to a local web server which compares these results to a database of reference points created with a neural network. The location of the device is approximated from these reference points and the user can have its location while using the Android app which makes requests to the local web server.
